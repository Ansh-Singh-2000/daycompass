## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calming light purple (#B19CD9) to promote focus and tranquility.
- Background color: A very light off-white (#F5F5F5), near the purple hue to give emphasis to content.
- Accent color: A muted blue (#779ECB), 30 degrees to the left of the primary on the color wheel, to provide contrast without being overstimulating.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font for its modern, objective look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clean and minimalist icons to represent different task categories, and the 'drag and drop' function. Each icon should be easily recognizable.
- A clean, single-column layout optimized for focus and clarity, and suited to task prioritization and a schedule timeline.
- Subtle animations on task completion, providing satisfying feedback to the user.
